##Markdown is a strange beast!

Having just looked at a cheat-sheet I'm curious to see how a table will look.

| It looks | Like this |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Step 1 | Do this. |
| Step 2 | Do that. |
| Step 3 | Live the dream! |

Did it work?

How about this to do list?

- [ ] Thing 1
- [ ] Thing 2
- [ ] Thing 3

2nd attempt.
