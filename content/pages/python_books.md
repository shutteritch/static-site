Title: Python Books

A few people who have seen my \#100DaysOfCode tweets have asked if I have any books to recommend. So here are a couple that I have found interesting/useful.

##[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Al Sweigart](https://amzn.to/3f7bfm1)

[![Automate the Boring Stuff - Cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SYS7OOBkL._SX376_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3f7bfm1)

I wish I'd found this book sooner. As someone who had used MS Excel quite a bit in the past, the practical approach to problem solving and the way it's presented worked quite well for me.

##[Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python - Joel Grus](https://amzn.to/2KSl5KJ)

[![Data Science from Scratch - Cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XwoyG7MrL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2KSl5KJ)

This book's a bit (a lot) above my pay grade but the first few chapters are really good at giving you a crash course in Python and getting you up and running with data visualisations and manipulation. If you're an intermediate Excel user, the first few chapters would have you doing the same things in Python.

I'm more interested in Python for the web at the moment (hence I've been doing the \#100DaysOfWeb course) but this book will stay on my shelf because it could be really useful if I want to do more data stuff in the future.

##[Django for APIs - Will Vincent](https://amzn.to/2ygP7VJ)

I'm still only part way through this book but so far it's been a great way to get up and running with Django Rest Framework, something I'll be learning more about as I progress with the \#100DaysOfWeb - I'm only on day 31 as I write this.
