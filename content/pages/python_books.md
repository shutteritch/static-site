Title: Python Books

A few people who have seen my \#100DaysOfCode tweets have asked if I have any books to recommend. So here are a couple that I have found interesting/useful.

##[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Al Sweigart](https://amzn.to/3f7bfm1)

[![Automate the Boring Stuff - Cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SYS7OOBkL._SX376_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)]((https://amzn.to/3f7bfm1)

I wish I'd found this book sooner. As someone who had used MS Excel quite a bit in the past, the practical approach to problem solving and the way it's presented worked quite well for me.
